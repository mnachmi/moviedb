problems *after* reading the documentation.

13.1 Upgrading to version 3.4
=============================

There are two upgrade options:

(1) If you have all the .list files
    -------------------------------

   (i) follow steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) in section 1.2

  (ii) copy all the list files (.list extenstions) and the 'filesizes' file
       from moviedb-3.3/lists to the directory moviedb-3.4/lists. 

 (iii) to compile all the programs, fetch the new/updated list files and create 
       the databases run:

          make install

       from the top level moviedb-3.4 directory.

  (iv) the search programs will be installed in the moviedb-3.4/bin directory,
       therefore you need to either add this directory to your path or run
       all the programs from this directory.

   (v) if all goes well you can now delete the old moviedb-3.3 directory

If the automatic FTP fetching script fails to work in step (iii) you will need
to manually get the new and updated files from one of the FTP sites, put
them in the lists directory and do 'make install-local' from the top-level
moviedb-3.4 directory.

(2) If you just have the database files
    -----------------------------------

   (i) follow steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) in section 1.2

  (ii) copy all the database files (everything in moviedb-3.3/dbs *except* the
       file moviedb-3.3/dbs/Makefile - you MUST delete or rename this file 
       before issuing the copy command) to the directory moviedb-3.4/dbs. 

 (iii) copy the file moviedb-3.3/lists/filesizes to moviedb-3.4/lists/filesizes

  (iv) to compile all the programs, fetch the new/updated list files and create 
       the databases run:

          make install

       from the top level moviedb-3.4 directory.

   (v) force a rebuild of a couple of changed databases:

          cd moviedb-3.4/etc
          ./mkdb -bio -create

  (vi) the search programs will be installed in the moviedb-3.4/bin directory,
       therefore you need to either add this directory to your path or run
       all the programs from this directory.

 (vii) if all goes well you can now delete the old moviedb-3.3 directory

If the automatic FTP fetching script fails to work in step (iv) you will need
to manually get the new and updated files from one of the FTP sites, put
them in the lists directory and do 'make install-local' from the top-level
moviedb-3.4 directory.

See section 12 for details on how to maintain the databases in this version.
