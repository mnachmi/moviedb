1. INTRODUCTION
===============

The Internet Movie Database is an international volunteer effort whose 
objective is to provide useful and up to date movie information *freely* 
available on-line, across as many systems and platforms as possible. It 
currently covers over 130,000 movies with over 2,100,000 filmography entries
and is expanding continuously. 

The database includes filmographies for actors, directors, writers, composers,
cinematographers, editors, production designers, costume designers, producers
and a miscellaneous catch all section; plot summaries; character names; movie
ratings; year of release; running times; movie trivia; quotes; goofs;
soundtracks; personal trivia; alternative names; certificates; color
information; country of production; genres; production companies; sound mix;
reference literature; filming locations; sequel/remake information; release
dates; advertising tag lines; detailed technical data; alternative versions;
laserdisc availability; and Academy Award information. 

The database aims to capture any and all information associated with movies 
from across the world, starting with the earliest cinema, going through to the
very latest releases and even movies still in production. Many thousands of 
movies are covered completely from the major actors to the minor bit players
and crew members. All the information comes from the users of the database so
please continue to support it and help it to grow. The database is updated 
weekly and is available over the world wide web, an e-mail interface or for
local installation on Unix, Amiga and MS-DOS machines.

In its six year history the IMDb has grown from a small informal project to a
major Internet resource. The WWW interface to the database is one of the most 
popular and well-known sites of any class on the web. It is frequently cited 
as a model for how to create and organise a major web site and has received 
numerious awards and honours over the years.

The movie database frequently asked questions list contains more information
on the whole movie database project and the different ways to access it. A 
copy is included in the package, alternatively send an e-mail message with the
subject:

  HELP FAQ

to <mail-server@imdb.com> and the movie mail-server will send a copy back. The
database is available via an e-mail interface and on the World Wide Web and
full details are given in this FAQ.


1.1 Requirements
================

This version requires a Un*x like operating system, an ANSI C compiler and 
approximately 100Mb of disk-space for the full standard version. The package 
includes support for compressed database files using 'compress' or 'gzip', 
bringing the requirements down to 30Mb of disk-space. There are options to
reduce the space further by discarding some of the databases that you might
not be interested in, so disk-space requirements can be as low as 20Mb.

You will need an ANSI compatible C compiler to compile the programs. If one 
wasn't supplied with your machine, I recommend the GNU C compiler 'gcc'. 
You can pick up a source code distribution of 'gcc' from ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu
in pub/gnu which can be installed on a wide range of machines. NOTE FOR
USERS OF SUN MACHINES: the standard Sun C compiler is *not* ANSI compliant
so you will need a copy of 'gcc' to install this package.

An Amiga version is also available both on AMINET (under biz/dbase) and from
the main anonymous FTP sites (see later)

An MS-DOS interface to the same data, but based on different software is also 
available from the FTP sites.


1.2 Installation
================

 (1) The database software is available from the FTP sites:

 uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu  in  /pub/info/imdb/tools/moviedb-3.4.tar.gz

 ftp.funet.fi in  /pub/culture/tv+film/lists/tools/moviedb-3.4.tar.gz

 ftp.fu-berlin.de  in  /pub/misc/movies/database/tools/moviedb-3.4.tar.gz

 sunsite.mff.cuni.cz  in  /MultiMedia/Movies/Database/tools/moviedb-3.4.tar.gz

 (2) get the file using anonymous FTP and unpack by typing:

       gzip -cd moviedb-3.4.tar | tar -xvf -

     this will install the software in the directory moviedb-3.4, 'cd' into
     the directory to continue.

 (3) since the package includes a program to automatically get the data files
     from the FTP site (and to keep them up to date), you need to give the
     package your e-mail address to use as the password for FTP. Edit the
     file Makefile and change the following line:

	LFETCHOPT = -auto
     
     to 

	LFETCHOPT = -auto -user <address>

     where <address> is your e-mail address.

 (4) follow the comments in the Makefile for further changes that might be
     required for installation on your system. In particular, don't forget to
     set CC and/or CFLAGS to enable ANSI compatible compilation.

     Also, pay close attention to the variables which describe how to handle
     the compressed list files (ZLISTCATCOM etc.) and how to enable support
     for compressed database files (ZDBSCATCOM etc.)

     The variables AUTOUNCOMPRESS and KEEPLISTS affect the amount of disk 
     space used by the package if your resources are limited. Please refer
     to section 12.2 for more information.

 (5) to compile all the programs, fetch the list files and create the 
     databases run:

	make install

     See section 12 if anything goes wrong with this process.

     NOTE: the database generation process does require quite a bit memory 
     and processing power to run. I've arranged to have ready made data
     files available on the FTP sites for people who have problems generating
     them locally. See section 12.1 for more details.

 (6) the search programs will be installed in the moviedb-3.4/bin directory,
     therefore you need to either add this directory to your path or run
     all the programs from this directory.

The package is now installed and you're ready to try it out, see the next
section for a quick introduction.

Section 12.2 has details on the one line command that you can use to ensure
the database is always up to date with respect to the FTP site.

If you do not have direct access to anonymous FTP or you have some special
configuration requirements, see section 12 for more details on a customized
set-up procedure and on fixing general problems.

 
1.3 Quick Introduction
======================

If any of these commands fails to work, see section 12 for details of
potential problems and how to resolve them.

The database supports many different kinds of queries and I refer you to the
rest of this manual for more information. This section is provided as a 
very simple introduction to searching:

To generate a filmography for a particular person including any personal
trivia, use:

  list -name <name> -full

where <name> is in "<surname>, <first name>" format. 

Examples:

  list -name "Hitchcock, Alfred" -full

  list -name "Hamilton, Linda" -full

  list -name "Grant, Cary" -full


To search for all the data on a particular movie (plot summary, year of
release, rating, cast, crew and trivia), use:

  title -t <title> -full

bearing the following in mind:

 - leading articles are placed at the end (e.g. "Terminator, The")

Examples:

  title -t "Vertigo" -full

  title -t "Aliens" -full

  title -t "Jurassic Park" -full

The remainder of this document describes the search programs and maintenance
process in more detail. All the programs in the package output a brief usage 
description if run with no arguments.

1.4 Database Structure
======================

The database is made up of many files which are maintained by different people 
on the internet. This section describes the files in more detail and gives
a contact address for the maintainer. The data can never hope to be complete
owing to the volume of movies being produced, therefore if you spot any
omissions, please let us know.

The most convenient way to send in new additions or corrections is via the
movie mail-sever's central collection service. For a complete submissions 
guide which covers everything send e-mail with the subject:

  HELP ADD FULL

to <mail-server@imdb.com>.

See the file CONTENTS for a description of all the files in the package.

The titles in the database fall into one of five categories:

 (1) movies, unless otherwise indicated the title is a movie
 (2) TV-movies, indicated by a (TV) tag
 (3) made for video movies, indicated by a (V) tag
 (4) TV-series, indicated by enclosing the title in "'s
 (5) mini-series, indicated by enclosing the title in "'s and a (mini) tag

1.4.1 Cast Lists
----------------

The character names information is published with the main list files,
but is still maintained separately by Steve Hammond.

  List             | Maintained by
  -----------------|--------------------------------------
  Actors           | Col Needham <actors@imdb.com>
  Actresses        | Col Needham <actresses@imdb.com>
  Cast Completion  | Col Needham <col@imdb.com>
  -----------------|--------------------------------------

Highlights from the actors and actresses lists are posted to rec.arts.movies
on a regular basis and contain filmographies for most popular performers in
those categories. The versions on the FTP sites contain the full lists with
all the actors and actresses known to the database.

Each filmography entry consists of up to five pieces of information: the 
name, the title, an attributes field (to store, for example, academy award 
nominations), the character name and a number to specify their position in
the credits. 

Please note that guest appearances on TV-shows are not eligible for the cast
databases owing to the volume and accuracy of this type of information.

Note that the actors and actress lists only contain filmography information -
biographical data such as date and place of birth, real name etc. is stored
in the biographies list.

The cast completion list simply records which movies we have full cast lists
for in the database (i.e. everyone listed in the credits of the movie is in
the actors/actresses lists).


1.4.2 Crew Lists
----------------

The following lists are of a similar format to the cast lists in that they
contain filmographies for people in the respective fields:

  List                 | Maintained by
  ---------------------|-------------------------------------------
  Cinematographers     | Michel Hafner <cinematographers@imdb.com>
  Composers            | Michel Hafner <composers@imdb.com>
  Costume Designers    | Harald Mayr <costumes@imdb.com>
  Directors            | Col Needham <directors@imdb.com>
  Editors              | Harald Mayr <editors@imdb.com>
  Misc. Filmography    | Col Needham <miscellaneous@imdb.com>
  Producers            | Andre Bernhardt <producers@imdb.com>
  Production Designers | Harald Mayr <prod-designers@imdb.com>
  Writers              | Jon Reeves <writers@imdb.com>
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
      

The miscellaneous filmography list is a "catch all" for people in careers not
covered by the other filmography lists. Anyone who worked on a movie can be 
listed here. The idea is to spin-off new filmography lists from it if new
list managers can be found and the volume of data relating to a particular
type of contribution justifies a new separate list.


1.4.3 Titles Lists
------------------

The following lists contain information that relates to individual titles:

  List                 | Maintained by
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------

  Alternative Versions | Giancarlo Cairella <versions@imdb.com>
  Certificates         | Mark Harding <certificates@imdb.com>

along with any awards given to the movie as a whole.

The plot summaries list has brief outlines of some of the movies in the
database.

The production companies list records the production company / studio which 
produced the movie.

The alternative names list contains details of different names people have 
been billed under during their careers, for example Joanne Whalley / Joanne
Whalley-Kilmer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. LIST PROGRAM
===============

The list program searches for filmographies for people in the database.

2.1 Database Options
====================

The -name option searches all of the filmography lists for information.
This is rather inefficient if you know which list the person will be on. The
following options can be used in place of -name to limit the search:

 -cast     search both cast databases
 -acr      search actors databases
 -acs      search actresses databases
 -dir      search directors database
 -write    search writers database
 -comp     search composers database
 -cine     search cinematographers database
 -edit     search editors database
 -prodes   search production designers database
 -costdes  search costume designers database
 -prdcr    search producers database
 -misc     search miscellaneous filmographies database

Examples:

  list -acr "Bogart, Humphrey"

  list -acr "Biehn, Michael"

  list -acs "Hepburn, Katharine"

  list -dir "Cameron, James"


2.2 Output Options
==================

A basic 'list' query just generates a filmography for the person concerned. A
number of output options are provided to link other information to the results:

 -yr    add the year of release to each title, and sort chronologically
 -yru   add the year of release, but leave unsorted

 -mrr   adds movie ratings report information to each title
 -smrr  adds movie ratings report information, and sort by average rating 
 -vmrr  adds movie ratings report information, and sort by number of votes

 -chr   for cast lists, adds character names in []'s where available
 -aka   add any alternative titles / names and search aka names database
 -bio   include information from biographies list and formats output neatly

 -full  combines -yr -chr -aka and -bio

Examples:

  list -acr "Grant, Cary" -yr -chr

  list -dir "Hitchcock, Alfred" -smrr


2.3 Control Options
===================

A couple of options are provided to control the search:

 -m          movies only: ignores TV-series and mini-series
 -i          case sensitive search: normally searches are not case sensitive
 -genre <s>  only include titles with a genre equal to <s>
 -time <s>   only include titles with a time equal to <s>
 -prodco <s> only include titles with a production company equal to <s>
 -sfxco <s>  only include titles with a special effects company equal to <s>
 -cert <s>   only include titles with a certificate equal to <s>
 -mix <s>    only include titles with a sound mix equal to <s>
 -cntry <s>  only include titles with a country equal to <s>
 -rel <s>    only include titles with a release date equal to <s>
 -loc <s>    only include titles with a location equal to <s>
 -tech <s>   only include titles with technical info equal to <s>
 -lang <s>   only include titles with a language equal to <s>

The options may be combined to constrain the search further.

Example:

 list -dir "Hitchcock, Alfred" -prodco Selznick
  -- list Hitchcock's movies made for Selznick studios

 list -dir "Hitchcock, Alfred" -mix Silent
  -- list Hitchcock's silent movies

 list -dir "Lang, Fritz" -genre Film-Noir -full -color "Black and White"
  -- list Fritz Lang's films noirs, shot in black and white

2.4 Substring and Approximate Matching
======================================

Ordinarily, the program requires an exact match in order to locate the 
information on a person. In some cases the exact spelling may not be known.
There are two classes of options which can help locate the specific person:
the first is substring matching, which treats the name you provided with the 
database option as a substring. The option to trigger this is '-s'. 

The second class is approximate matching, which enables names with a limited 
number of character differences to still match. The options to trigger this 
are -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 and -9 where the larger the number, the larger the 
number of differences allowed for a match. 

Examples:

  list -cast "Barrymore" -s -full

  list -acr "rGant, Cary" -2 -full


2.5 Multiple Name Queries
=========================

Any number of database and name options may be combined in the same query
to generate a list of movies that all the people worked on together. 

Examples:

  list -dir "Hitchcock, Alfred" -acr "Grant, Cary" 

  list -acs "Hepburn, Katharine" -acr "Tracy, Spencer" -yr

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TITLE PROGRAM
================

The title program searches the database for all the information relating
to a specific title. The basic option is '-t <title>' which specifies the
movie to search for. If there is more than one movie in the database with
the same title, details on all matches are returned.

3.1 Output Options
==================

A basic title query just returns the names of the people who worked on the 
movie. A number of options are provided to add further information to the
results:

 -aka     add any alternative titles
 -mrr     add movie ratings report data
 -yr      add year of release and any title attributes
 -pl      add plot summary
 -trivia  add movie trivia, crazy credits, goofs, quotes, soundtrack info,
          certificates, color information, countries, genres, production
          companies, running times and sound mix.
 -full    combines all of the above options

Examples:

 title -t "2001: A Space Odyssey" -full

 title -t "Cape Fear"
  -- returns details of both the 1962 and 1991 versions of this movie

 title -t "Cape Fear (1991)"
  -- returns details of just the 1991 version

3.2 Miscellaneous Options
=========================

The following options are also available:

 -i        case sensitive search: normally searches are not case sensitive
 -s        substring: match on substring rather than whole title

The -s option is particularly useful for finding details of all the movies
with the same name. For example:

 title -t "Thin Man" -full -s

3.3 Multiple Title Searches
===========================

Any number of '-t' options may be combined in the same query to generate a 
list of people that worked on each and every one of the movies.

Example:

  title -t "Ghostbusters" -t "Ghostbusters II"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. LISTALL PROGRAM
==================

This program can be used to generate filmographies for each person involved
with a particular movie.

Example:

  listall -t "Abyss, The" -full

The following options are also available:

  -yr     add year of release to titles and sort chronologically
  -yru    add year of release, but leave in alphabetical order

  -mrr    add movie ratings report information
  -smrr   add movie ratings report and sort by average ratings
  -vmrr   add movie ratings report and sort by votes

  -chr    add character names where available
  -bio    add biography data
  -lit    add literature data
  -bus    add business data
  -ld     add business data
  -aka    add alternative title data (and check if title is an aka title)

  -full   combines -aka -bio -chr -yr -bus -ld -lit

  -i      case sensitive search
  -m      restrict search to movies only (ignore TV-series)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. LGUIDE PROGRAM
=================

This program works like 'title' except that it takes a list of titles from a 
file and searches for information on each one. I find lguide really useful for
generating a little movie guide to accompany the TV schedules for the local 
movie channels. To use the program simply type the titles into a file, one on 
each line and enter:

 lguide -f <filename>

Other options:

  -yr      adds year of release information
  -mrr     adds movie ratings report information
  -pl      adds plot summary and formats results
  -trivia  add movie trivia, crazy credits, goofs, quotes, soundtrack info,
           certificates, color information, countries, genres, production
           companies and sound mix.
  -chr     add character names
  -aka     lists any alternative titles
  -full    combines all above options

  -i       case sensitive search

A report of any titles which are not found in the database is written to the
standard error stream. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. LTRACE PROGRAM
=================

This program displays all the information about each of the movies that someone
has worked on. The options are similar to those for 'list':

 -acr <name>      search for actor
 -acs <name>      search for actress
 -cast <name>     search both cast databases
 -dir <name>      search for director
 -write <name>    search for writer
 -comp <name>     search for composer
 -cine <name>     search for cinematographer
 -edit <name>     search for editor
 -prodes <name>   search for production designer
 -costdes <name>  search for costume designer
 -prdcr <name>    search for producer
 -misc <name>     search miscellaneous database
 -name <name>     search all filmography databases

 -yr          adds year of release information
 -mrr         adds movie ratings report information
 -pl          adds plot summary and formats results
 -triv        add movie trivia and formats results
 -chr         add character names
 -aka         lists any alternative titles
 -full        combines this group of options

 -m           movies only, ignore TV-series
 -i           case sensitive search

For a good example try:

 ltrace -dir "Hitchcock, Alfred" -full

finds the list of Hitchcock's movies then reports full details on each one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. LINDEX PROGRAM
=================

This program can be used either to generate lists of names that appear 
on filmography lists or to generate lists of titles from the movies list.
It's uses include finding exact spellings of names or titles on the lists; 
finding names/titles containing a particular substring; and finding titles
released between a range of years or in a particular year.


7.1 Database Options
====================

For title mode, simply use:

 -title

For name mode, any combination of these options can be used:

 -acr       actors database
 -acs       actresses database
 -dir       directors database
 -write     writers database
 -comp      composers database
 -cine      cinematographers database
 -edit      editors database
 -prodes    production designers database
 -costdes   costume designers database
 -misc      miscellaneous database
 -prdcr     producers database

Note, if you do not specify any database options then the default is to search

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. ALIST PROGRAM
================

This program searches the attribute fields of all the databases. Examples
of the kind of queries you can construct include:

 * search for details of all best actor academy award winners

 * search for movies nominated for best picture

 * search for all movies narrated by a particular person

 * search for all plays by a particular writer that have been filmed


8.1 Database Options
====================

For title mode, simply use:

 -title

For name mode: 

 -acr       actors database
 -acs       actresses database
 -dir       directors database
 -write     writers database
 -comp      composers database
 -cine      cinematographers database
 -edit      editors database
 -prodes    production designers database
 -costdes   costume designers database
 -prdcr     producers database
 -misc      miscellaneous database

Only one database option is allowed in each run.


8.2 Search Options
==================

These options specify the information to be searched for:

 -aa              academy award winners
 -aan             academy award nominees
 -gg              golden globe winners
 -ggn             golden globe nominees
 -attr <pattern>  values matching <pattern>

The academy award options can be combined together to give a list of all 
winners and nominees. The same is true for the golden globe options.

These options can be used to limit the search in various ways:

 -m               restrict search to movies only

 -yrfrom <yr>     restrict search to titles released during or after <yr>
   -yrto <yr>     restrict search to titles released before <yr>

8.3 Miscellaneous Options
=========================

 -s    substring: allow partial matches with -attr
 -i    become case sensitive in -attr searches
 -yr   adds year of release to titles and group results by year


8.4 Examples
============

alist -dir -aa -aan -yr
 -- search directors database for academy award winners/nominees and sort
     by year

alist -title -aa -aan -yr
 -- search for best picture academy award winners/nominees and sort by year

alist -aa -dir -yr -yrfrom 1940 -yrto 1949
 -- lists all best director oscar winners of the 1940s by year

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. MKBALLOT PROGRAM
===================

This program generates a movie rating ballot for all the movies a particular 
person has been involved with. The options conform to the standards used in the
list program:

 -acr      actor
 -acs      actress
 -dir      director
 -write    writer
 -comp     composer
 -cine     cinematographer
 -edit     editor
 -prodes   production designer
 -costdes  costume designer
 -prdcr    producer
 -misc     miscellaneous

The results should be redirected to a file where you can add in votes for
the movies you have seen and then mail the file to the vote tabulator. For
further details on taking part in the movie ratings poll see the weekly
postings in rec.arts.movies.

Example:

  mkballot -acr "Bogart, Humphrey"
   -- generate a ballot for all Bogie's movies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. LFORMAT PROGRAM
===================

This program provides a number of features for formatting whole databases, 
combining the information with the movies list or the movie ratings report. 


10.1 Database options
=====================

These options specify which database you would like to format:

 -acr       actors database
 -acs       actresses database
 -dir       directors database
 -write     writers database
 -comp      composers database
 -cine      cinematographers database
 -edit      editors database
 -prodes    production designers database
 -costdes   costume designers database
 -prdcr     producers database
 -misc      miscellaneous database


10.2 Format Options
===================

 -yr    Adds the year of release information and sorts each person's entries
	into chronological order.

 -yru   Adds the year of release information, but leaves entries in
	alphabetical order.

 -mrr   Adds the information from the movie ratings report to each title.

 -smrr  Adds the information from the movie ratings report to each title and
	sorts each person's entries by average rating.

 -vmrr  Adds the information from the movie ratings report to each title and
	sorts each person's entries by number of votes.

If no format option is given, the program formats the results in the style of
the published lists.


10.3 Output Options
===================

      -r  raw mode, don't format results
      -m  movies only, ignores TV-series

10.4 Examples
=============

   lformat -acr
     -- regenerates published form of actors list

   lformat -dir -yr
     -- formats directors database & adds year information

   lformat -acs -mrr
     -- formats actress list and adds ratings report information

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. LSEEN PROGRAM
=================

This program is for use in conjunction with my movie ratings report voting 
support scripts. This program counts/sorts/formats lists, extracting films you 
have seen based on data from your votelog file.

If you don't use the voting support scripts, they are available via anonymous
FTP from uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu in pub/info/imdb/tools/voting_scripts.gz

If you'd like a copy of your votelog file from the movie ratings database,
contact me via e-mail and I'll send it to you.

11.1 Creating the Votes Database
================================

Place a copy of the votelog file in:

   moviedb-3.4/lists/votelog

then from the moviedb-3.4 directory type:

   make votes

In order to get maximum benefit from 'lseen', titles in votelog need to be
compatible with those in the movies list (moviedb-3.4/lists/movies.list). A
list of the incompatible titles will be displayed each time you do a 
'make votes'. Titles are considered compatible if they match apart from 
their case (titles in votelog should be in lowercase) and (TV)/(V) tags
are not needed in votelog.


11.2 Database Options
=====================

These options specify which database you would like to use:

 -acr       actors database
 -acs       actresses database
 -dir       directors database
 -write     writers database
 -comp      composers database
 -cine      cinematographers database
 -edit      editors database
 -prodes    production designers database
 -costdes   costume designers database
 -prdcr     producers database
 -misc      miscellaneous database

11.3 Output Options
===================

   -us  unsorted, don't sort data by total movies you have seen

   -yr  add the year of release to each title, and sort chronologically
  -yru  add the year of release, but leave unsorted

  -mrr  add movie ratings report info 
 -smrr  add movie ratings report info, sort by average ratings
 -vmrr  add movie ratings report info, sort by number of votes

11.4 Control Options
====================

  -min <value>  limit output to people who you've seen at least <value> 
		 of their movies

11.5 Examples
=============

 lseen -dir 
  -- count directors

 lseen -acr -mrr -yr
  -- count actors and display ratings report and year info for each movie

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. MAINTAINING THE DATABASE 
============================

The database can be maintained entirely via the Makefile in the top level
moviedb-3.4 directory. All the 'make' commands in this section should be run 
from this directory. See the comments at the top of the file for a full list 
of all the options supported, including installing the man pages. Many thanks 
to Phil Queinnec <queinnec@enseeiht.fr> for the Makefiles.


12.1 Ready Made Database Files
==============================

The program which generates the internal database files from the ascii text
list files requires quite a bit memory and processing power to run. I've tried
to keep the requirements to a minimum, but there may be problems on some
machines. I've therefore arranged for ready made database files to be 
available via FTP in addition to the source list files. You can now choose
whether to install from the list files and run the generation process locally,
or to just install the ready made databases instead. The files have been
wrapped in a 'tar' archive and are available via anonymous FTP:
 
 uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu  in /pub/info/imdb/tools/ready-made-data.tar.gz

 ftp.funet.fi in /pub/culture/tv+film/database/tools/ready-made-data.tar.gz

The ready made database files will only be updated at most monthly so if you 
want the latest data available, I recommend continuing to use the list files 
(the default). If you do want to use the ready made files, follow these 
alternative installation instructions:

 (1) follow steps (1) to (4) as described in section 1.2

 (2) from the moviedb-3.4 directory run:

       make all

 (3) get the ready made database file from the nearest FTP site as listed 
     above, place it in your moviedb-3.4 directory and run:

       gzip -cd ready-made-data.tar | tar -xvf -

 (4) The files should now be installed so continue to follow the standard
      installation instructions from step (6) in section 1.2


12.2 Updating via FTP
=====================

If you have open access to the internet via FTP, the database can be maintained
completely automatically. Simply type:

  make update

and the system will check the FTP site to see if any of the files have been
modified since you last did an update, get them automatically and regenerate
the appropriate database files. Doing this every couple of weeks or whenever
you see an announcement in r.a.movies about a list being updated will ensure
that you always have the latest files.

If you don't have direct access to the FTP site or aren't comfortable with
the system initiating FTP transfers behind your back: manually place copies
of the updated list files in the database directory and type:

  make update-local

NOTE: Writing an automatic FTP program that runs on most machines has proved
      very difficult so on some systems you'll have to manually get the files.  


12.3 Customized Installation
============================

The standard installation assumes that you have direct and open access to
the FTP site via the 'ftp' command and that you have 47Mb of free disk-space to 
store the database. In reality, I don't expect these assumptions to be true
in the majority of cases. This section describes how to modify the 
configuration and how to reduce the disk-space requirements.

12.3.1 Reducing Space Requirements
----------------------------------

By default the system uncompresses all the list files before processing them.
To leave them in their compressed form, set the top-level Makefile variable
AUTOUNCOMPRESS as described in the comments. This represents a saving of 16Mb
and only affects the performance at database generation time - it doesn't
affect the searching of the database later.

Once a database file has been created, you do not need to keep the 
corresponding source list file. The surplus list files can be deleted by:

  make cleanlists

This step reduces the space requirements by a further 11Mb. If you set the
variable KEEPLIST in the top-level Makefile as directed in the comments, the 
system will automatically delete the lists each time it has processed them. 

The next thing to consider is compressing some or all of the databases. The
programs can all search compressed databases transparently although 
performance does suffer as a result. Many thanks to Timo Lamminjoki 
<lamminjo@fltxa.helsinki.fi> for the code to do this. To compress the main
database files use:

  make compress

This saves an additional 7Mb. If space is an absolute premium you can save a
further 500K by using:

  make maxcompress

to compress the index files too (at the cost of a further performance hit).
These figures assume you are using 'gzip' to compress the database - it is
faster and compresses better than 'compress'. 

All these steps bring the disk-space requirements for the database files down 
to just 12Mb. The following steps now save space by reducing the amount of
information in the database.

Another saving of about 1Mb (uncompressed) can be made if you are not 
interested in storing TV-series information: edit the Makefile changing the
line:

  MKDBOPT = 

to

  MKDBOPT = -m

A saving of 2Mb (uncompressed) can be made if you aren't interested in 
the character names information: edit the Makefile and add the option 
-nochar to the MKDBOPT variable:

  MKDBOPT = -nochar

Finally, to remove any databases you aren't interested in, 'cd' into 
moviedb-3.4/dbs and delete the associated files, for example to eliminate 
the editors:

  rm editors.*

then from the top-level directory do:

  make touch-dbs

to create empty versions of the deleted files. Please make sure you delete 
all the files associated with a particular list by using the wildcard '*' 
for the filename extension as above.

12.3.2 FTP set-up
-----------------

If you only have access to FTP via indirect commands such as 'gate-ftp' or
wish to modify the ftp parameters in some way, edit the file 'lfetch'. In
the area after the initial comment block there are some variable assignments
which you can edit to suit your system.


12.4 Troubleshooting
====================

This section will be expanded according to the feedback I receive on how
easy the package is to install and what the common problems are. I recommend
reading section 12.3 first! If you are still having problems with the package
after reading this section, contact me via e-mail: <col@imdb.com>.

(Q1) The automatic list collection doesn't work on my machine even after
     adjusting the configuration variables?

(A1) Get the files manually and run:

       make update-local


(Q2) The system fails to create the database files from the compressed list
     files?

(A2) Get the files automatically (if you can) by running:

       make do-lfetch

     or get the files manually and then run:

       gzip -d *.gz
       make update-local


(Q3) The FTP transfer failed part-way through an update?

(A3) Enter the following (in the moviedb-3.4/lists directory):

       mv filesizes.old filesizes

     to reset the local state and start the update again.


(Q4) How do I make the auto-fetch program get a file from the FTP site even
     when it thinks the local and remote files are the same?

(A4) From the lists directory run: 

       ../etc/lfetch -force -user <e-mail address>

     together with the appropriate option(s) as described in the comments in
     the 'lfetch' file.


(Q5) I deleted all the list and database files but when I do a "make update"
     the program says that all the local files are up to date?

(A5) The system keeps track of which lists you have updated by recording their
     sizes in a file when they are downloaded. To reset this file use:

       make reset-ftp

(Q6) Whenever I do a search the programs don't return any results or I get
     several error messages of the form:

      ../moviedb-3.4/dbs/actors.dbs.gz: No such file or directory

(A6) The automatic fetching program probably failed to collect the list
     files and therefore the databases could not be created. See (A1) to
     fix this.

(Q7) The database generation program 'mkdb' fails to create the database files

(A7) Check to see that your shell has not placed limits on your stack size.
     If that doesn't solve the problem, use the ready made database files
     instead (see section 12.1 for details)


12.5 Logfiles
=============

If the database is installed on a multi-user machine and you'd like to keep
track of the usage, the programs can append various details to a system
log file. To enable this feature see the "LOGFILENAME" variable in the top
level makefile.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. CHANGES FOR USERS OF VERSION 3.2
====================================

This section describes changes for users of the previous version.

13.1 Upgrading to version 3.4
=============================

There are two upgrade options:

(1) If you have all the .list files
    -------------------------------

   (i) follow steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) in section 1.2

  (ii) copy all the list files (.list extensions) and the 'filesizes' file
       from moviedb-3.3/lists to the directory moviedb-3.4/lists. 

 (iii) to compile all the programs, fetch the new/updated list files and create 
       the databases run:

          make install

       from the top level moviedb-3.4 directory.

  (iv) the search programs will be installed in the moviedb-3.4/bin directory,
       therefore you need to either add this directory to your path or run
       all the programs from this directory.

   (v) if all goes well you can now delete the old moviedb-3.3 directory

If the automatic FTP fetching script fails to work in step (iii) you will need
to manually get the new and updated files from one of the FTP sites, put
them in the lists directory and do 'make install-local' from the top-level
moviedb-3.4 directory.

(2) If you just have the database files
    -----------------------------------

   (i) follow steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) in section 1.2

  (ii) copy all the database files (everything in moviedb-3.3/dbs *except* the
       file moviedb-3.3/dbs/Makefile - you MUST delete or rename this file 
       before issuing the copy command) to the directory moviedb-3.4/dbs. 

 (iii) copy the file moviedb-3.3/lists/filesizes to moviedb-3.4/lists/filesizes

  (iv) to compile all the programs, fetch the new/updated list files and create 
       the databases run:

          make install

       from the top level moviedb-3.4 directory.

   (v) force a rebuild of a couple of changed databases:

          cd moviedb-3.4/etc
          ./mkdb -bio -create

  (vi) the search programs will be installed in the moviedb-3.4/bin directory,
       therefore you need to either add this directory to your path or run
       all the programs from this directory.

 (vii) if all goes well you can now delete the old moviedb-3.3 directory

If the automatic FTP fetching script fails to work in step (iv) you will need
to manually get the new and updated files from one of the FTP sites, put
them in the lists directory and do 'make install-local' from the top-level
moviedb-3.4 directory.

See section 12 for details on how to maintain the databases in this version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. ADDING TO THE DATABASE
==========================

The database depends on its users to keep it accurate and up to date. A copy
of the complete additions guide is included with the software in the file:

  moviedb-3.4/docs/ADDS-GUIDE

Mark Harding's template generation software is also included in the
distribution. The programs are 'template' for title based templates and 
'templist' for name based templates. The usage is:

  title -t <title> -full | template

  list -name <name> -full | templist

The output from these commands should be redirected to a file which can then
be edited to include your changes. The updated files should be mailed to
the additions processor <mail-server@imdb.com> with the subjects:

  UPDATE TITLE  

  UPDATE NAME

for title and name based additions respectively.

For example:

  title -t "Vertigo" -full | template > adds.vertigo

  vi adds.vertigo
 
  mail -s "UPDATE TITLE" mail-server@imdb.com < adds.vertigo


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
